1. Requirements: Ensure you have Python installed, along with popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. Data:Place your dataset in the designated folder and update the file path in the Python script.

3. Code:Refer to the Python script for the translated code, mirroring the original R analysis.

4. Execution: Run the Python script to perform market segmentation analysis using Python.
